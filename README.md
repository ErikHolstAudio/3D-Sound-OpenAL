# 3D-Sound-OpenAL
Small project that sets up OpenAL on Mac and Windows, with a simple wav-reader class.

The project file is a Qt .pro file but it does not use any Qt code, just plain C / C++, and OpenAL.

The project inlcudes a release compiled version of https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft, but should be compatible with https://www.openal.org version as well.

openal-soft is compiled with MSVC from Visual Studio 2019.
